# Cambridge Supervision Template
## Introduction
This is a template I have made so that I can use Typst instead of Latex for my supervision homework, as Kudos uses the format of the document to correctly upload the homework.
It currently 'copies' the format for the Latex, as well as providing functions to display questions and answers (which let you easily add qr-codes and more).

I intend to add more features in the future, but feel free to use the template. There is an example typst file included in this repo as an example of how it's used.
