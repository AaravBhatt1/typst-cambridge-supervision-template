# Cambridge Supervision Template
## Introduction
This is a template I have made so that I can use Typst instead of Latex for my supervision homework.
It currently 'copies' the format that John gave for uploading Latex homeworks to Kudos, and provides functions to display questions and answers (which let you easily add qr-codes and more).

I intend to add more features in the future, but feel free to use the template. There is an `main.typ` file included in this repo as an example of how it's used.
